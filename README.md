# GymGui UNDER CONSTRUCTION
A project I am translating from a text based interface to Graphic User Interface

This was a school project meant to demonstrate our knowledge of polymorphism and inheritence.
The original finished project was text based.

I intend to turn it into a fully fleshed out GUI with far more functionality than the project originally called for.
I may even go as far as to include payment API, but right now I don't know.

At the moment it is just a simple member registration tool.
